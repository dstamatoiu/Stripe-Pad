## Contributing

Any contributions to Stripe Pad are welcomed. If you have any ideas or suggestions for new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

IMPORTANT: The main advantage of Stripe Pad is being an unopionated package, the challenge is to maintain every component decoupled from others, there is no js library, no CSS framework. I don't guarantee that it will be like this in the future, but the effort will go always in this direction.
