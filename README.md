# Stripe Pad

Stripe Pad is a micro SaaS boilerplate that allows you to quickly build projects and integrate Stripe payments from the beginning. It is a fast and efficient way to sell your products configured in Stripe, acting as a front-end for your Stripe account.

You will also need to configure your Stripe account and add your API keys to the `.env` file.

  cd stripe-pad
  composer install
  
## Usage

Once your Stripe account is configured, you can easily create and manage products within the Stripe Pad interface. The boilerplate also includes basic checkout functionality and a sample thank-you page.

You can also customize the look and feel of the front-end as per your need.
